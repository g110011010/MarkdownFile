## Course 25 Do the English speak English?
>I arrived in London at last, the railway station was big black and dark, I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked the porter. I not only spoke English very carefully but very clearly as well. The porter, however, could not understand me. I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. He answered me but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly, I am a foreigner, I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him . My teacher never spoke English like that! The porter and I looked at each other and smiled, then he said something and I understood it, “You will soon learn English! ”, He said, I wonder, In England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand each other but I don’t understand them, do they speak English?
